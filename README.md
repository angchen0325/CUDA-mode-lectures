# CUDA-mode-lectures

In this repository, I will be learning CUDA programming by following the lectures and notes from the [repository](https://github.com/cuda-mode/lectures) provided by the [CUDA-mode team](https://github.com/cuda-mode). 

I will be using the [CUDA toolkit 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive) on windows platform for this course, and I will use a [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4080-family/) for coding.
